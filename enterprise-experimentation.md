# Enterprise Experimentation

## Lean Engineering: Principles for Enabling Build/Measure/Learn in the Enterprise
1. Engineer for learning.
	- Read “How Buildings Learn” by Stewart Brand
	- Every building we build is a prediction of the best building possible.
	- Most organizations’ biggest challenge is moving from a **culture of delivery** to a **culture of learning**. (Less focus on deliverables.)
	- Products are like trains. If it departs infrequently, everyone will scramble to get their features on the train, otherwise it’ll be a long time before the next opportunity. If it departs frequently, it’s no big deal — there will be another opportunity to ship something new soon.
	- Continuous customer feedback is key.
	- Customer metrics drive everything
	- Think it. Build it. Ship it. Tweak it.
	- Fail fast, learn fast.
	- Lots of experimentation. Build/measure/learn.
	- “We call features ‘barnacles.’”
	- Enable prototyping in the engineering stack.
	- Because engineering teams are not trying to solve the learning problem, they see prototyping as outside the engineering stack. This is a real engineering challenge.
	- Engineer for the “living spec.”
	- Better to fail in small increments than to fail big all at once.

2. Democratize innovation.
	- “If you can’t feed a team with two pizzas, it’s too large.” - Jeff Bezos
	- Keep teams small.
	- Democratize the code base. Use GitHub.
	- Use git repo model for continuous deployment. Marketing pages, product pages, content, components, etc.
		- Works well with cloud deployment (devops model)
		- Enables the train to be leaving all the time.
	- The best way to get inner adoption is through outer adoption. Open-source as much as possible, allow others to add to and improve it. Contribute.
	- It’s easier to hire people if they can Google your framework and learn it before the interview.

3. Use lean to give agile a brain.
	- Agile is just a machine.
		- It’ll crank “stuff” out. That stuff may be good or bad.
		- Have a tight loop with our users.
		- Iterate to get experiences “in the ballpark.”
		- Make it easy to iterate designs ahead of agile sprints.
	- PayPal had two tracks — lean UX team, agile scrum engineering team
	- Get teams to shared understanding. Get everyone speaking the same language.
	- Enable deep collaboration. You can’t create great software or great design without partners in different disciplines.
	- Get continuous customer feedback.
	- Does your team “defend the solution” or “embrace the problem?”


## Innovation Studios: The Engines of Enterprise Experimentation
- Many large enterprises want to be innovative.
- They treat innovation as a spice that you can sprinkle on the organization to build some magical new thing.
- Result of fear of being disrupted
- Disruptive enterprise innovation is difficult
- Most companies focus on shipping products rather than achieving outcomes.
- Don’t want to alienate existing customers!
- Long turnaround times, calcified decision-making processes, make innovation hard.
- Don’t want to threaten core businesses with disruptive innovation.
- The desire to embrace innovation is real.

Three ways that companies try to embrace disruptive innovation:
1. Hackathons
	- There’s no incentive to make it successful.
	- It’s just a creative outlet.
2. Innovation Labs
	- Rarely aligned with corporate strategy
	- The handoffs between innovation lab to product team don’t usually work well
	- Goal is to be innovative, not to solve customer problems
	- Tend to get shut down (Nordstrom, eBay) as corporate realizes they don’t work well
3. Corporate-Wide Innovation Programs
	- Part-time effort. Requires employees to work in their spare time. Not tied in to corporate strategy.

Let’s build **innovation studios**.
- Hire the right people. Generalists, entrepreneurial people, those who are dedicated to measuring customer behavior.
- Other teams will improve as they see the studio’s success.
- This is entrepreneurship for 40+ year olds. (those who don’t want to live on ramen and sleep under their desks)
- Requires funding, independent of the rest of the organization. Time horizon of 18mo to 3 years
- Requires radical transparency. Must be public; the rest of the organization needs to see successes and failures alike.
- Winning ideas have to be officially funded through the business, whether as a spin-off company, new business unit, joint venture, etc.
- The team that came up with the winning idea **goes with it**. Absolutely essential.
- Focused on **getting to products faster**.
