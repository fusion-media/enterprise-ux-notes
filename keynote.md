# Opening Keynote - Catherine Courage
Co-author of “Understanding Your Users”
SVP, Customer Experience at Citrix

- When employees are given subpar software, they’ll beat the system by finding workarounds.
- IT is terrified when employees go out and find their own solutions.
-  UX is inherently a journey. Can’t get a great experience instantly — it happens over time.

## Phases of the UX Journey

### Chaos
- It’s important to set the expectation that experience is going to be an area of investment.
- Be about culture change. Make UX Design part of the organization’s DNA.
- Listen and understand before taking action. Don’t assume anything about others’ understanding of design and your role within the organization.
- Get people thinking about the experiences that they love.
- Develop a design language that people can identify with and relate to.
- Bring in speakers from outside to talk on design subjects.
- Get some quick wins. Prove your value early on.

#### Building a Killer Team (Like, a great team. Not a team of assassins.)
- **Finding**. Get a great recruiter; someone who knows UX.
- **Assessing**. Evaluate the candidate’s talent and culture fit.
- **Winning**. Articulate the company’s value proposition to attract candidates.
- **Retaining**. Compensation, recognition, and learning/developing talent is important. Be proactive.
- **Developing**. What are the skills that people need? How is the field evolving? Get people the skills they need to remain relevant. Teach the business, not just design skills.


### React & Influence
- Focus on things you can influence.
	- Work on workflow and the way design integrates with other things. Experience -> Product Management -> Product Development -> Experience -> etc.
- Who is the customer? Remember the difference between the buyer and the user. Appeal to the admins who are deploying the products, and the end users who are using them.
- Walk in their shoes. Take engineers, project managers, etc. on field trips to see people using our work.
- Learn to tell stories when you return from field trips. Customer videos, quotes, testimonials, cartoons, etc. Storytelling is critical.
- Create an experimentation mentality throughout the organization.
- Formulate concepts. Rapidly prototype.
- Get constant customer feedback.
- Iterate. Fail fast, fail early. Don’t do “grand reveals.”
- Middle management is risk averse. The ground-level and the C-level likes change; the middle does not.
	- Citrix sent middle managers to a design bootcamp at Stanford. Great for eliminating roadblocks and getting buy-in to design.
- Get space to create. Work better by developing better space.


### Organize & Impact
- What’s our charter? Codify our design mission.
- Learn to scale. “More projects” does not equal greater success. Say “no” to good projects so you can say “yes” to great ones.
- Start thinking about organizational structure. How is our design team structured?
- Develop your employees. Teach them the business, not just design.


### Refine & Differentiate
- Provide an exceptional experience to every user, every time.
- Look at the whole ecosystem, not just an individual product.
- Don’t wait for permission. Go after the problems you think should be tackled.
- Engage in business design, not just product design.
- Success is related to trust, credibility, and impact. Prove why UX should have a seat at the table.

## Themes Across the Journey
- You have to fight through some bad days to earn the best days.
- “The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.” - George Bernard Shaw
- Much of the job is marketing — broadcasting to the rest of the organization what UX is doing.
- Community engagement is critical to success. Be part of the design community. Meet people, learn from people, and develop relationships.
