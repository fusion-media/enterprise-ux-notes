# Insight at Scale

## Insight Types That Influence Enterprise Decision Makers
- Who are our enterprise customers?
	- End users, admins, and customers (buyers).
- Each needs something different to succeed. “Not getting fired” is universal, though.

### A Simple Model of User Experience
- Start by meeting user needs. Center of everything.
- After that, focus on usability. Make interaction and tasks easy.
- After that, sound. Content/copy/IA is clear and relevant.
- After that, look & feel. Visual and industrial design are aesthetically pleasing.

- The produce is perceived from the outside in. Aesthetics are noticed first, then sound, then usability, then the product’s ability to meet needs.
- If the layers are too difficult to penetrate, the user will never find out if the product fulfills a need.

### User Research Methods
- **Qualitative vs. Quantitative**. Qualitative data is gathered directly by the researcher. Quantitative is gathered indirectly via an instrument (web log, survey, etc.) Qualitative answers why & how. Quantitative answers how many/how much.
- **Behavioral vs. Attitudinal**. What people do vs. what people say.
- **Context of use**. How did the data get collected?
	- Natural (Examine natural behavior and attitudes)
	- Scripted (Focus insight topics or enforce consistency)
	- De-contextualized (Issues under study are broader than product usage)
	- Hybrid

- **Usability Lab Studies**. Single-user user product/prototype. Lab-based. Usually scripted. Behavior > Attitude
- **Ethnographic Field Studies**. Observation of work or natural use of products. Goal is to understand through the eyes of the observed. Most powerful/flexible method.
- **Focus Groups**. “The F-Word of User Research”
- **Clickstream Analysis & A/B Testing**. Big data. Quantitative.
- **Surveys**. Attitudinal, not behavioral.
- **Concept Testing**. Do we have the right idea? If not, what is better? Who’s the target? What makes it work? Hybrid method. Can be qualitative or quantitative.

### Insight Challenges and Opportunities
- So many potential sources of information!
- Sales/customer contacts may put up a brick wall between you and the end users.
- Data is often anecdotal, third-hand, self-reported, or conflicting. _Especially_ when dealing with high-level execs.
- Different types of enterprise “users.” End users want it to be usable. Admins want it to be easy to deploy, maintain, and fit in with their workflow.
- Needs of users vs. buyers inevitably lead to conflict.

### Using Time to Our Advantage
- Different phases of a project should leverage different types of research.
- **Strategize**. What direction do we go? Ethnographic studies, interviews, focus groups, clickstream analysis, etc. Focused mostly on user needs.
- **Optimize**. How shall we do it? Participatory design, concept studies, prototype evaluations, usability lab studies, etc. Focused on usability, sound, look & feel.
- **Assess**. How well did we do? A/B Testing, other quantitative methods.

### You can’t do it all.
- There’s too much in the way of research to do everything.
- Do something quantitative, and do some field studies, and finish with a quantitative assessment. That’s the really important stuff.


## Data Science and Design: A Tale of Two Tribes
- Big data is not a panacea. Won’t cure every problem.
- Data Scientist is part stats geek, part hacker, part entrepreneur.
- Intuit’s Design for Delight
	- Develop deep customer empathy
	- Go broad to go narrow
	- Rapid experiments with customers
- How can designers and data scientists work together?

“The value of an idea lies in the using of it.” - Thomas Edison

- When building something, consider the product, users, and payoff.
- Always have a metric for success.
- Focus on leading indicators, not lagging indicators. Don’t fall into the trap of only measuring the end of a process.

Example:
**Lagging Indicators**
- A/B Testing Platform Success
- Experiments Per Week
- New End-User Features

**Leading Indicators**
- Ease of use of platform
	- Number of users vs. target
	- Time to consumption
- Awareness of platform across dev community
	- Visits to services directory
	- Enhancements Requested
- Quality of Platform
	- Uptime
	- Time to Insight
- Ease of Implementing Change
	- Test results reflect reality?
	- Enhancement backlog

1. **Data shifts the conversation from “I think” to “I know.”**
2. **Data brings focus to the design process.**
3. **Design brings data to life.**
