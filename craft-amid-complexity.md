# Craft Amid Complexity

## The Architecture of Understanding
- When working with middle managers, we often have the authority to observe a problem but not the authority to do anything about it.
- In the early days of a product or service, every new feature adds goodness. Eventually, there’s an inflection point after which adding new features makes the product/service worse. Our job is to recognize that inflection point and affecting the culture around it to simplify.
- Most people don’t understand the difference between simple-simple and elegant-simple.
- It’s hard to change course when an organization is large. Agile/lean is great, but it leads us to dismiss the importance of planning.
- Hard to recognize the line between inspiration and planning.
- Playing and practicing are aspects of planning.
- The difference between planning and making is a false dichotomy. Planning incorporates a little doing; making incorporates a little thinking.
- It’s hard to discuss systems in words. Words and sentences are inherently linear; systems happen all at once.
- It is the responsibility of the architect to know and concentrate on the critical few details and interfaces that really matter.
- We can’t just design and manage information systems; we need to understand the nature of information in systems.
- Categories hide more than they reveal. “Classification is dangerous, but not bad.”
- Categories are the cornerstones of cognition and culture.
- Most categories are fuzzy, without clear boundaries.
- We often use radio buttons when checkboxes or sliders would reveal the truth.
- “The system always kicks back.”
- “The Ethnographic Interview,” by James Spradley, is essential reading.
- Culture is like water to a fish; ubiquitous, but nearly invisible.
- “The Corporate Culture Survival Guide,” by Edgar H. Schein, explains how to elucidate culture
- We are dangerously predisposed to naïve intervention.
- Mapping the invisible allows us to effect change. It’s like when we unearth underground rivers in old cities.
- Map the system, then map the context.
- “Where architects use forms and spaces to design environments for inhabitation, information architects use nodes and links to create environments for understanding.”
- “No house should ever be on a hill or on anything. It should be of the hill, belonging to it.” - Frank Lloyd Wright, on organic simplicity


## The Wicked Craft of Enterprise UX
- What is “craft” in the digital medium?
- How do we reconcile craft with enterprise UX?
- Let’s shift our definition of craft from **beautiful final object** the speaks of aesthetic refinement and romanticism to **facilitative anchor** that enables productive teamwork and decisions
- The original definition still matters. We still have to be creating a beautiful, precious object. If we’re selling something for as much as we do, it better look like it costs that much. We’re selling that quality and attention to detail.
- Beauty makes good economic sense. It implies trust, reliability, dependability, and integrity. Craft is good business. Nobody wants to buy or use a sloppy product.
- The enterprise space is a “forest of wickedness.” Buyer vs. User, multi-faceted relationships, thousands of objects and actors defined within the database, political currents to navigate just to “fix the app,” legacy tech framework, newly acquired platform vendors, etc. It’s a tangled mess.
- Craft can help us cut through this mess. We can use our process and methods to navigate the forest.
- The artifacts we craft are ephemeral. Sketches, mock-ups, prototypes, sticky notes, etc. To get to the precious final artifact, we must wade through the muck of the enterprise, which means doing things that aren’t precious.
- Use our craft and ephemeral artifacts to drive debates and decisions.
- See problems differently by making things by hand. Learn kinesthetically.
- Empower a maker culture.


## Thoughts about Craft at Scale
- GE became the world’s 15th-largest software company without realizing it. Decided to create a software division in response.
- Building the “industrial internet of things.” Collecting and analyzing data about industrial things like wind turbines.
- How to take that data and make it usable to people?

- Scale craft by creating design systems rather than individual designs:
	- A modular set of parts
	- Frameworks and patterns for structure, form, composition, appearance, and behavior
	- Standards for tone and character

- It’s more like Lego than a set of rules. Enable anyone to put something together. Tools, not rules!

**Design system hypotheses**:
1. Product teams could use a system to be (somewhat) successful without some or no UX design help.
2. It would accelerate software development and product definition.
3. It would align the efforts of a decentralized community of UX designers across GE.
4. It would allow designers to focus on the interesting, novel stuff. No more “what does a button look like?”
5. It would allow us to evolve our product experiences in a unified way.

**The Industrial Internet Design System** = Visual Language + Interaction Patterns + Technology Framework

- Design systems should include rules for usage. For instance: “Radio buttons should be used for options that are mutually exclusive.”

- **Evangelism, Adoption, Impact**. Had to sell design system to engineering teams.
- **Organizational Evolution, Design System Evolution**. Don’t want to limit variation and good design. Created design system extensions for different verticals — marketing communications, healthcare, etc.
