# Designing Organizational Culture

“Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” - Peter Drucker

## Creating a Culture of Design
- Culture Quotient = (Artifacts * Embrace) / (1 / Time)
- There is no silver bullet. To affect design change, we must do everything with everybody.
- Artifacts = People + Practices + Places
- Design thinking is the scientific method for the 21st century.
- Consistency is not design. Uniformity is not design.
- Consistency is a good thing, until it isn’t.
- Don’t worry about “having” to change. Create a culture that _can_ change
- Drive changes, not adherence.
- Unity, not uniformity.


## Case Study: Citrix and Corporate Change
Read “The Ultimate Question,” by Fred Reichheld. Introduces the Net Promoter Score, which is apparently a thing that’s important.


## Redefining Value: Bridging the Innovation Culture Divide
- Business treats value in terms of performance. It’s about trying to quantify and create value. Business value is **functional** and **financial**.
- In design, we add three things to the definition value: **emotional**, **identity**, and **meaningful**.
- Design tends to do this intuitively. We need tools to do this in a replicable, repeatable way.
- Value can only be exchanged in the context of relationship. Hence, relationship is critical to all kinds of business.
- Business gets this on one level, but it isn’t illuminated through business tools like spreadsheets and formulae.
- Relationship sits within experience. We create experiences to drive relationships, and relationships drive value.
- Emotional, identity, and meaningful value sit below the surface. Less visible than quantitative value.
- Levels of value, from a personal perspective:
	- Functional (Does it do what I need it to do…)
	- Financial (…at a price that’s worth it?)
	- Emotional (How does this make me feel?)
	- Identity (Is this _me_?)
	- Meaningful (Does this fit into my worldview?)
- If you’re in a conversation on price, you’ve already lost the sale.
